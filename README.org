* DESIGN PATTERNS
Repository to keep track of my progress with design patterns.

** OO Principles
- encapsulate what varies
- favor composition over inheritance
- program to interfaces, not implementations
- strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- code should be close for modification but open for extension

  
** Patterns that flew by...
1. Strategy pattern
   - defines a family of algorithms
   - encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable
   - lets the algorithm vary independently, depending on how the
     clients decides to use it
2. Observer pattern
   - is a design pattern that is used when there is an observable and
     observer
   - used in one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
     object changes state, the other objects are
     notified/updated/respond automatically
