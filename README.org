* DESIGN PATTERNS
Repository to keep track of my progress with design patterns.

** OO Principles
- encapsulate what varies
- favor composition over inheritance
- program to interfaces, not implementations

  
** Patterns that flew by...
1. Strategy pattern
   - defines a family of algorithms
   - encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable
   - lets the algorithm vary independently, depending on how the
     clients decides to use it
