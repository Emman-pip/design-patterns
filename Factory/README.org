* Factory design pattern

A pattern that prevents the use of "new".

** What is it?
Factory design pattern is essentially a pattern that handles the
details of object creation. This pattern allows abstraction when it
comes to the creation of objects and decoupled classes interaction. 

** Why use it?
The new keyword is a concrete implementation. Every time it is used,
one is programming to an implementation thus violating the design principle.
