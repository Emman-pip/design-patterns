* Command Pattern
Encapsulating the method invocation

** What is it?

A pattern that allows commands to be passed then translated to program
behavior.

A command object encapsulates a request to do something (like turn on
a light) on a specific object (say, the living room light object).

The command pattern encapsulates a request as an ogbject thereby
letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue
or log requests, and support undoable operations.
